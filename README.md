# UT-IT  Assignment Description. What it does and how it works
This assignment is divided into three parts. In the first part, the task is to write code to check the strength of a password provided by the user. The password must meet certain criteria, such as having both uppercase and lowercase letters, alphanumeric and specific special characters, and not containing the user's name. The code should also use loggers and handle errors appropriately. The second part involves creating a class that checks for duplicate elements in a list and calculates the factorial of a given number. Unit tests should be written for these functions. The final part requires writing unit and integration tests for three classes: User Validation, Company Validation, and Email Validation. Each class has specific validation requirements, such as checking if a company already exists in the database or if an email address is valid. ScalaStyle is also used to ensure proper indentation and alignment. In summary, this assignment involves developing code and tests for password strength, list manipulation, and data validation.
